# Movies-ETL

## Overview
In this project we are creating an end to end ETL pipeline. From **EXTRACT**ing movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, and **TRANSFORM**ing the datasets to clean it and finally **LOAD**ing into a SQL database.

## Results
As a result of the ETL process we created and stored to tables:

1. Movies Table
